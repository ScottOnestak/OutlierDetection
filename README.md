# Outlier Detection
Detecting outliers in Yahoo's webscope anomaly detection data sets using different outlier detection algorithms.

Dataset can be found here: http://webscope.sandbox.yahoo.com/catalog.php?datatype=s&did=70

Each of the folders contain the source code for each of the different methods used to model the data and predict outliers within the data sets.

BenchmarkResults.xlsx and results.xlsx contain the individaul breakdowns of outlier detection on each of the files and calculate the overall accuracy of the models.

Curtis-Onestak Outlier Detection.docx is our report on our findings.

Curtis-Onestak Presentation.pptx is a powerpoint presentation in addition to the report.
