# Outlier Detection

Detecting outliers in Yahoo's webscope anomaly detection data sets using different outlier detection algorithms.

Dataset can be found here: http://webscope.sandbox.yahoo.com/catalog.php?datatype=s&did=70

Each of the folders contain the source code for each of the different methods used to model the data and predict outliers within the data sets.

**_BenchmarkResults.xlsx_** and results.xlsx contain the individaul breakdowns of outlier detection on each of the files and calculate the overall accuracy of the models.

**_Curtis-Onestak Outlier Detection.docx_** is our report on our findings.

**_Curtis-Onestak Presentation.pptx_** is a powerpoint presentation in addition to the report.
